  ## Description
  Navigate through the command line interface and design a vehicle through a series of quesitons.  Through some basic typescript, a user can either create or select from a list of vehicles and apply various actions.  This application  helped me as the developer obtain a better understanding of typescript, classes, and object-oriented programming.

  In order to install the application, please download and upload all appriorate files from the Github to your remote device.  Once all the files are uploaded, navigate to the terminal and type 'npm init -y' to initalize the node program module.  Once a package.json is created, go  into the file and add  ' "type": "module" '  after the description.  Now we can go back into the terminal and install the packages.  Type "npm i" and  a node_modules folder will be created and populated.  From there with all the correct code, we can now run the command " npm run start"  to begin the application.
